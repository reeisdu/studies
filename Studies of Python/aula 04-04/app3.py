# Activitie 3: Here weÂ´re crating a variable that will guard the list (that has the "[]") and, when we
# write "in", that means all the things did write IN the list. Better: the things that is wrote IN the 
# list will be guarded on the variable (capish?)
# And when we write (len(x)), that means this code will say how many letters make up the Word. 
# for example: Word 'cat': has three letters.


animals = ['cat','dog','lion','camel']
for a in animals:
    print(a, 'size string: ', len(a))

sequence = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in sequence:
    print(num)
